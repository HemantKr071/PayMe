# PayMe 

**PayMe Web Application**

PayMe is a learning project designed to simulate the functionality of a payment application like Paytm. Built on the **MERN stack**, it does not involve real money, bank APIs, or payment gateways. Instead, it focuses on implementing core features such as secure user authentication, transaction management with demo money in user accounts, and real-time tracking for educational purposes.

**Tech Stack Used:**

- **Frontend:** Developed with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.

- **Backend:** Implemented on Node.js and Express.js for RESTful APIs.
Database: Utilizes MongoDB for data storage.

**Key Features:**

- **Simulation of Payment App:** Mimics a payment application's functionalities without real financial transactions.

- **JWT Authentication:** Provides secure user sessions using JSON Web Tokens.

- **Password Hashing:** Ensures password security with bcrypt during user registration.
